#### Usage
----------------------

To run the bot, you first will need to create a Twitch Dev account, and then create an oauth token. Due to this frequently changing, I recommend you look into the best, current method of doing this.

Once that is complete, complete the following steps:
* Clone the repo to your desired location
    * git clone https://github.com/Sub-Lockdown/TwitchPolyglot.git
* Using requirements.txt, install the required modules
    * pip install -r requirements.txt
* Run the inital chatbot.py run, which will create the .env file
    * python chatbot.py
* Modify the .env file adding in your information

* Now run the chatbot.py to get the bot up and running
	* python chatbot.py

Once running, the bot is currently setup to translate all Spanish messages to English, and using the '?translate ' prefix, will translate English messages to Spanish.
